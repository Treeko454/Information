<h1>Hello How r </h1>


<p>Did you know that recently top-secret documents from the Pentagon were leaked? Congress thought that someone from the inside had been paid off, or that someone on the inside was a spy, but it turns out that someone who worked in IT leaked the documents on discord. They were flexing that they had access to top-secret government files, and a discord member said "Shut the fuck up, you cuck." and in retaliation, the IT worker leaked the documents. These documents had war plans to assist Ukraine, along with many other things. The CEO of Discord may have to go to court over this, like Tiktok recently went to court. </p>
